# ♟️ Chess System in Java

This project was developed as part of the **Java Complete Course (by Nélio Alves)** with the goal of strengthening core Java concepts and applying Object-Oriented Programming principles in a real, functional system.

It is a **fully playable chess system for the terminal**, including movement logic, validations, error handling, and essential game rules.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project was built to **reinforce and consolidate the concepts learned so far**, especially:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Custom exceptions
- Class composition
- Matrix-based data structures
- Layered architecture (board, chess, UI)
- Clean code and best practices
